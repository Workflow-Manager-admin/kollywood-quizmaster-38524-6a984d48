# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Developer Note: Solving "Invalid Host header" in Development

**Does your dev server refuse connections from remote or cloud environments? Do you see "Invalid Host header"?**
- This project does NOT use Create React App's built-in dev server, nor does it use craco/react-app-rewired. Instead, it uses a custom Webpack config with a start script in `package.json`:

  ```
  "start": "cross-env EDIT_MODE=true webpack serve --config .ve/webpack.config.js --mode development --disable-host-check --host 0.0.0.0"
  ```

  This script already includes the necessary flags to disable host checks.

**Recommended .env for stubborn dev/build environments:**  
```
HOST=0.0.0.0
DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true
FAST_REFRESH=false
PUBLIC_URL=.
```
- `PUBLIC_URL=.` is important for production builds with `react-scripts build` to prevent `ReferenceError: PUBLIC_URL is not defined` errors.

1. Use `npm start` as above for development.
2. If you still get this error, or if a production build fails, create `.env` with those settings in `kollywood_quizmaster_frontend/`.
3. See `DEVELOPER-README.md` for detailed explanation—typically, NO extra configuration or ejection is required.

## Important Note: Babel Configuration

This project’s `package.json` includes a `babel` section with a plugin:

```json
"babel": {
"plugins": ["./.ve/babel-plugin-jsx-editor-id.js"]
}
```

This plugin enables **visual editing functionality** in supported tools.

**Warning for AI code agents and contributors:**
**DO NOT** remove or modify this section - it is ESSENTIAL for proper operation.
Removing it will break editor integration and visual editing features.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
